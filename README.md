# Integrated Project — Maji Ndogo Water Services (Part 3) | Audit Verification, ERD Validation, and Strategic Insights

## 📌 Introduction
This phase focuses on auditing, validating database relationships, and producing **operational recommendationsnto strengthen the reliability of the Maji Ndogo water data systems. Our aim was to ensure the integrity, accuracy, and trustworthiness of stored data, enabling confident use for decision-making and governance.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Audit the Database: Verify that data is accurate, consistent, and free from tampering.
2. Validate the ERD: Identify and correct relationship errors between key tables (e.g., `visits` and `water_quality`).
3. ntegrate Auditor Reports: Compare auditor scores with employee-reported scores to detect anomalies.
4. Operational Insights: Summarize findings and propose improvements for water service delivery.

## 🛠 Audit Process and Findings
### 1. Audit Scope
* Focused on the `auditor_report`, `visits`, `water_quality`, `employee`, and `location` tables.
* Verified data entry and modification procedures** to ensure compliance with good governance principles.

### 2. Key Findings

* Integrity: The majority of records were consistent and accurate.
* Relationship Issue Found:

  The `visits`  `water_quality`** relationship was incorrectly shown as many-to-one in the ERD.
  * In reality, `record_id` ensures **one-to-one mapping** — one visit corresponds to exactly one water quality assessment.
* Score Anomalies: Some employee scores differed significantly from auditor scores (>9-point gap).
* Repeat Visits: Multiple visits per `location_id` confirmed strong one-to-many relationships between `location` and `visits`.

## 📊 ERD Corrections

* Corrected Relationships:

`location (PK location_id)` → `visits (FK location_id)` : One-to-Many
`visits (PK record_id)` → `water_quality (FK record_id)` : One-to-One✅
 This correction reduces query duplication and prevents mismatched records during joins.
## 🔍 Auditor vs. Employee Comparison
Using SQL joins and CTEs, we:
* Identified **records with mismatched scores** (`auditor_score` vs. `employee_score`).
* Flagged employees with above-average mistakes for further training.
* Integrated potential pollution datamfrom `well_pollution` for combined risk assessment.
## 📌 Operational Insights
1. Employee Performance
   * A small group accounts for most scoring discrepancies.
   * Targeted retraining recommended.
2. High-Risk Water Sources

   * Locations with both poor auditor scores and high pollution indicators need **urgent intervention**.
3. Data Accuracy
   * The corrected ERD prevents inflated row counts and ensures accurate joins.
## ✅ Recommendations**

* Implement ERD Fixes: Update schema documentation and diagrams.
* Automate Score Anomaly Checks Use SQL triggers or scheduled jobs to detect large auditor/employee score gaps.
* Pollution-Linked Interventions**: Prioritize remediation for locations with both poor quality scores and pollution flags.
* Continuous Auditing: Schedule quarterly data integrity reviews.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Deploy ERD updates** to all team members.
2. Integrate anomaly detection queries into reporting dashboards.
3. Begin remediation** for flagged high-risk water sources.
4. xpand auditing** to cover maintenance logs and infrastructure metadata.
